    "text": "Data and Code Availability Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Policy at EJ\n\n\n\nThis is a reproduction of the official Data and Code Availability Policy of the Economic Journal, which can be found here. In case of discrepancy, the official policy always prevails to the reproduction presented here.\n\n\nThe Economic Journal requires authors of empirical, experimental or numerical papers to provide documentation of how their results were obtained in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow their results to be replicated. When you submit a paper for consideration, you will be asked to confirm that you are willing to comply with this policy. It is essential that you request a data exemption at the point of first submission if you face any restrictions that prevent you from publishing your data or, in general, from complying with any of the provisions of this policy. More details on this process are provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Will my Paper be Accepted for Publication?\n\n\n\nYour paper will be accepted for final publication only after the results have been checked for reproducibility.\n\n\nOur mission is to conduct the reproducibility checks as fast as possible. Please read the information on this website carefully, so we can achieve this goal. Please, also note the following warning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with the requirements set out in detail below for each type of paper.\n\n\nOnce the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal’s repository at zenodo.org and it will be linked with the paper. Alternative repositories may be acceptable as long as they are considered “trusted” by the journal. Submission on such online repositories indicates that the authors license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and cite both the replication package and the paper accordingly.\n\nEmpirical papers\nFor papers that contain descriptive, econometric or simulated analysis of data, the authors must provide sufficient detail in the paper (or in an appendix) for the reader to understand the nature of the data used and how it was analyzed to produce the results. Importantly, they also must provide a replication package containing the following:\n\nA README file (README.pdf) describing the content of the package, the data sources (including citations), any manipulation that was carried out to generate the final datasets, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. In case of commercially available or restricted access data sources, detailed instructions (e.g. extraction code) to obtain the datasets should be included in the README file. Click here for a README template which we strongly recommend to follow, and here for a highly recommended README online generator app.\nThe raw datasets used in the paper and appendices (including online), including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. If the data is provided in a proprietary format, such as in Stata format, then a non-proprietary version (.csv for instance) should also be provided for each data set.\nAll computer code necessary to produce the analysis data and to re-produce all releveant output in the paper: tables, figures, and in-text numbers appearing in the paper as well as supplements and appendices. In case of simulation studies and other proceedures which depend on a sequence of random numbers, the authors are requested to appropriately seed their random number generators, so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained. If the code uses additional packages that are not part of a standard distribution of a certain software package, then these packages should be included so that the code still runs after many years.\n\nAuthors who have requested an exemption for the publication of their datasets can either (1) grant temporary distance or physical access to the data to the journal’s staff for the sole purpose of replication (the data will not be published), or (2) supply a simulated dataset or a synthetic dataset instead of the actual dataset(s) used for the analysis for replication purposes. The nature of the data used for the reproducibility checks will be indicated on the published version of the paper.\n\n\nExperimental Papers\nFor papers that contain analysis of experimental data (i.e. data which they generated with the help of experimental subjects), we require the authors to provide at the time of submission of the paper the following items (authors are asked to include all information as part of the main pdf file rather than as separate items):\n\nA document outlining the design of the experiment.\nA copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.\nInformation on the selection and eligibility of participants.\nExplicit reference to the approval of the Institutional Review Board of one of the authors’ institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution). Alternatively, authors (including all co-authors) who did not have an ethics board at their institution when the study was conducted may apply for an exemption. Authors who apply for an exemption will be expected to certify that the study complies with the requirements set out in this document. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to deny exemptions.\n\nIn addition, before final acceptance, the authors will be asked to submit a replication package containing:\n\nA README file (README.pdf) describing the content of the package, the data sources (including citations), any manipulation that was carried out to generate the final datasets, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. In case of commercially available or restricted access data sources, detailed instructions (e.g. extraction code) to obtain the datasets should be included in the README file. Click here for a README template which we strongly recommend to follow, and here for a highly recommended README online generator app.\nThe programs used to analyze the data and/or run the experiment.\nThe raw data collected from the experiment (also in non-proprietary format such as .csv)\nA document outlining the design of the experiment.\nA copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.\nInformation on the selection and eligibility of participants.\nA copy of the IRB approval or confirmation that an exemption has been granted by the editorial board."

You can find a set of Frequently Asked Questions about the situations under which you can or cannot apply to an exemption to the data and code availability policy here.\nIf you want to request a Data Exemption, you need to select the second option for the Data Policy box during your submission process at the Editorial Express platform, as illustrated in figure Figure 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Data Policy Exemption\n\n\nAdditionally, attach a Cover Letter along with your paper in which you indicate the reasons why you believe you are entitled to an exemption to our data and code availability policy.\nOnce the paper is submitted, the Managing Editor will analyze whether (i) there are enough grounds to grant the exemption and (ii) the exemption or the nature of the data limits the interest of the paper. Based on her assessment of these two points, she will make one of the following decisions: (a) move forward with the process, sending your paper to referees, (b) summarily reject your paper, or (c) contact you asking to provide additional information, documentation, or any other requirement that she needs to assess the suitability of the requested exemption. The exemptions are tacitly granted by choosing option (a).\nOnce your paper is conditionally accepted, you will be requested to supply your replication package according to the guidelines specified here on this website. If an exemption to the Data and Code Availability Policy was granted, you will be requested to either provide the Data Editor (and, by extension, to the team of replicators) with temporary access to the data affected by the exemption for the sole purpose of implementing the reproducibility checks. Alternatively, when granting temporary access to the restricted data is not possible, you will be required to include in your package a synthetic or simulated dataset that allows users to run the code and check that it produces all outputs from the paper (and appendices), even if the results do not match those in the paper. You can find a set of FAQs questions about how to proceed with the replication package when an exemption to the Data and Code Availability Policy has been granted here."

    "section": "Scope of Reproducibility Checks at EJ",
    "text": "Scope of Reproducibility Checks at EJ\n\nWhat is the exact nature of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe purpose of the reproducibility checks carried out at the Economic Journal is to verify three aspects of the replication package: (i) it is complete, in the sense of producing each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online; (ii) it is self-contained, in the sense of not requiring a subprogram or module not included in the package; and (iii) the data and code are adequately documented for other researchers to be able to use them to replicate the results in the paper. When the data are accessible (included in the package or, in case of exemptions, via temporary access by the reproducibility team), the checks ensure that the code exactly reproduces the results in the paper and its appendices. In the case of a data exemption, authors may provide simulated or synthetic data to check that the code runs and produces all output, but the exact results cannot be checked. Reproducibility checks (not replication checks) are conducted. This means that our checks do not screen for coding errors, discrepancies between what the paper claims the code does and what it actually does, econometric errors, or whether the empirical approach followed in the paper can be reproduced in other environments or other datasets.\n\nAre the reproducibility checks implemented on online appendices?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, the replication package should produce each table, figure, and in-text number in the paper and its appendices, including those online. All these codes are checked for their ability to produce the results in the paper and appendices.\n\nWhy is the Economic Journal running reproducibility checks? Why not replication checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe firmly believe that reproducibility and replicability are the main pillars of science. The nature of replication checks requires time, effort, and resources that journals typically do not have: the publication process should be speedy for science to advance at the right pace. Our reproducibility checks provide a necessary first step: to ensure that authors publish all available data and the codes that generate the results they present in the papers we publish, and, importantly, to check that these codes and data run and produce the published results. The certification that we provide enhances transparency, since it assures that other researchers can reproduce the published research and test it against other datasets, assumptions, methods, etc. It also provides an additional service to the authors, as we often detect small errors that are better amended before publication than in an erratum afterwards."

    "section": "Data and Code Availability Policy and Exemptions",
    "text": "Data and Code Availability Policy and Exemptions\n\nMy paper uses publicly available data. Is it enough to indicate how to get them or should I provide my datasets as part of the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEven publicly available data should be included in the replication package to ensure they remain available in the future for anyone who wants to replicate your results. The only exception is when your exact extract is published in a \"trusted\" repository (see the following list for guidance) with a permanent DOI. This is important, because datasets are often updated (or removed) by the provider, and your version of the data may no longer be available to researchers in the future.\n\nMy paper uses publicly available data. Does it imply that I certainly have the right to re-publish my dataset along with the replication package? If not, how can I obtain permission to publish the data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEach provider offers a different policy regarding re-distribution of original and transformed datasets. Some providers, for example, allow re-distribution as long as your extract is deposited in a specific repository. You should make sure about the restrictions to publish your data before the first submission. You should also make sure to seek permission from the original owner of the data to publish them, and make sure to cite the original source accordingly.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, you can request an exemption on the grounds that the data are restricted-access. The request should be made at the time of initial submission, in a cover letter addressed to the Editor. The Editor in charge of your submission will determine whether your request is justified before submitting the paper to referees. If the Editor decides against the exemption, the manuscript will not be sent to referees, and you will be requested to either accept the data and code availability policy or otherwise the paper will be rejected. Submission fees will not be returned in that case. When an exemption is needed for a dataset that is incorporated to the analysis during the editorial process, the exemption should be requested at the first iteration in which the new data are incorporated.\n\nCan I request an exemption that affects only a part of my data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, provided that the request is made at the time of initial submission.\n\nIf my main dataset is available to publish, but there is a small portion of my data that I am not allowed to share, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. If you do not require a data exemption at the time of your first submission, you will be required to publish all the data used in your paper.\n\nIf the only data I am not allowed to share is only used in the online appendix, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. The data to produce all results in the paper and appendices, including those online, should be shared unless an exemption is requested and granted at the time of first submission.\n\nIf the data I use are publicly available to everyone, but I do not have permission to re-publish it, should I request a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Unless you are granted an exemption at the time of first submission, you will be required to publish in the replication package all data to produce all results in the paper and appendices, including those online.\n\nCan I request an exemption later than the first initial submission?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn general, no. Later exemptions can only be requested for new data that is incorporated into the analysis during the editorial process. If your data cannot be published and you did not request the exemption at the time of initial submission, your paper may be rejected for publication at Economic Journal.\n\nIf my data are free of charge and available to any researcher who requests it from the data provider, but I don’t have the right to publish it with the replication package, should I request an exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Whenever the data used for the analysis in the paper cannot be published with the replication package (or in an open-access \"trusted\" repository, see the following list for guidance on what constitutes a \"trusted\" repository) an exemption needs to be requested at the time of first submission. Only if the exact extract that was used in the study is published in the repository and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by the code, an exemption will not be requested.\n\nSome data providers only allow authors to distribute the data in specific open repositories (for example, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics only allows to distribute the data using the OpenICPSR Repository). Do I need to request an exemption in such cases?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo. Data archived in \"trusted\" open repositories (see the following list for guidance) is acceptable in the replication package provided what is published is the extract that was used in the study and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by your code. The Data Editor will evaluate the suitability of the repository.\n\nIf I published my data in an open repository, do I need to include it in the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nData archived in \"trusted\" open repositories (see the following list for guidance) is acceptable in the replication package provided what is published is the extract that was used in the study and it is readily available in the exact format that is called by the code. The Data Editor will evaluate the suitability of the repository and whether or not there is the need of publishing a copy with the package on the journal’s repository.\n\nIf I publish my replication package on my website (or similar), do I need to submit a replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Personal websites are not considered \"trusted\" open repositories, because there is no guarantee that the package will be systematically archived. See the following list for guidance on what constitutes a \"trusted\" repository.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my data because I collected these data and I want to keep exclusivity rights for future research?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo. The goal of our data and code availability policy is to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research, and this requires publishing the data you collected. If others can use your data, your research will gain visibility.\n\nCan I apply for data exemption if my data come from a commercial data provider (Datastream, Orbis, …)?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Restricted access data is generally discouraged, but when the nature of your research largely relies on a specific dataset and cannot be conducted on an open alternative, those data are eligible for an exemption. However, you may be requested to provide a certification from the provider indicating that the data will be archived and made available to other users following the same procedure to request access to it.\n\nCan I request an exemption for the experimental data I collected?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn general, no. Data should be anonymized to ensure that subjects cannot be identified. Only when the nature of the study impedes such anonymization, the authors can request a data exemption, which will cover only the required minimum to ensure the anonymity of the experimental subjects.\n\nCan I request an exemption to publish my code?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nNo.\n\nCan I use any software, proprietary and open source?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Open source software is encouraged, but licensed software is allowed. If the authors use software which is rather uncommon and requires special licenses, we ask for their cooperation to find a solution (which might entail providing remote access to the authors’ machine to our replicators in extreme cases.).\n\nDo I need to publish packages and libraries that are used by my code but not part of the standard distribution of the software used?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever possible, yes. If these packages or libraries are available in open repositories (e.g. most Stata packages), a clear indication on how to download and use them is sufficient. If the libraries cannot be included in the packages and are not publicly available, the Data Editor will be in contact with the authors to coordinate on a feasible way to implement the checks."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "Procedures when Exemptions Are Granted",
    "text": "Procedures when Exemptions Are Granted\n\nIf I was granted a data exemption, how should I proceed with the replication package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf you were granted a data exemption, your paper would still need to go through reproducibility checks before final acceptance. In order to do so, you can either (i) grant temporary (distance or physical) access to the data to the reproducibility team for the sole purpose of the checks (the data will be destroyed or access terminated after the checks), or (ii) supply simulated or synthetic dataset(s) instead of the one(s) used in the analysis.\n\nWhat is the difference between simulated data and synthetic data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nA simulated dataset is generated by a model (ideally, your model). A synthetic dataset is a scrambling or perturbation of the actual dataset to ensure anonymity.\n\nIs it better to provide temporary access to the restricted data or to provide a simulated/synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever feasible, we strongly recommend providing temporary access to restricted data. There are numerous advantages of this approach: (i) it saves the effort of producing synthetic or simulated datasets; (ii) the certification provided by the journal is stronger in the sense that we certify that we have been able to reproduce the results published in the paper as opposed to only checking that the code is complete, runs, and produces output for all tables, figures, and in-text numbers published in the article and its printed and online appendices; (iii) we can detect if the results cannot be reproduced, which gives the authors a chance to fix any errors before publication.\n\nWhat is the procedure followed by the Economic Journal when I supply restricted datasets for the sole purpose of the reproducibility checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe reproducibility team will treat the data with the highest ethical standards, preventing any violations of confidentiality, and using them exclusively to run the reproducibility checks. The restricted datasets will be destroyed as soon as the checks are performed and, therefore, they will not be published.\n\nWhat shall I do if I am not allowed to provide temporary access to the confidential data, but the data provider can run the code to implement the reproducibility checks?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEven if you cannot provide direct access to the reproducibility team, this option is preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset alternative as long as the checks can be executed in a reasonable amount of time. In this case, you need to supply the replication package to the journal and the contact of the data provider. The reproducibility team will send the code to the provider and the provider will send the output back to the team, who will check the results.\n\nWhat can I do if I am not allowed to provide temporary access to the confidential data, but a certification agency (e.g. cascad) can run the code in the original data source?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThis option is still generally preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset alternative. However, you should seek approval by the Data Editor before making any commitments with the certification agency. The Economic Journal, however, will NOT be able to cover the cost of certification.\n\nIf my restricted-access data provider has a public use testing sample (smaller sample, or perturbed dataset), can I provide this sample instead of a simulated/ synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf this option is available, it is generally preferred to the simulated/synthetic dataset (but less preferred to providing temporary access to the original data) as long as the testing sample can be published with your package. Otherwise, a simulated/synthetic dataset that can be published with the package is preferred.\n\nWhat is the procedure followed by the Economic Journal if I supply simulated/synthetic datasets?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe simulated/synthetic dataset will be published with the replication package. Even if these are not the real data, their structure, which by design will largely mimic the actual dataset, will give readers a better sense of your data. Please make sure the manipulations used to produce the synthetic/simulated datasets are described in the ReadMe file.\n\nWhy am I requested to supply a simulated/synthetic data?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nOur view is that, when reproducibility checks cannot be performed on real data, there is still an advantage of running them on such simulated/synthetic datasets: they are still useful to make sure the code is complete and self-contained, and that it runs without errors.\n\nMy article estimates a non-linear model. The algorithm does not converge with randomly generated data. What shall I do?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn this case, we strongly recommend simulating data using your model as data generating process. If that is not feasible, please contact the Data Editor explaining in detail why this is the case. The Data Editor will either assist you in the process, and, eventually, s/he will make a proposal to your original Editor about how to handle the situation.\n\nHow do I decide whether to produce a simulated or a synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn order to generate a dataset that mimics the same characteristics as the original one, the synthetic option may be easier. There are many open source routines that do it for you. However, there are also two main disadvantages: (i) you need to make sure that your scrambling/perturbation algorithm ensures correct anonymization of the data; and (ii) non-linear estimation routines may not converge on synthetic data, whereas they are more likely to converge in an artificial dataset generated by the model that you are estimating.\n\nHow should I produce a synthetic dataset?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThere are multiple ways to generate it. You can find some useful links with helpful resources, mostly in R, here, here, here, and here"

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "Implementation of the Reproducibility Checks",
    "text": "Implementation of the Reproducibility Checks\n\nHow long do the reproducibility checks take?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe usually provide the outcome of our reproducibility checks in less than two weeks. If the package is not complete or the code does not run, more than one iteration may be required, in which case the processing time might be increased. Articles that require a relatively long running time may take longer. The processing time also depends on how responsive the authors are to our requests.\n\nHow do the reproducibility checks work?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe reproducibility checks are handled by our Data Editor and our reproducibility team: a team of advanced Ph.D. students that have been hired to carry out the checks under the supervision of the Data Editor. Once an article is conditionally accepted for publication at the Economic Journal, the authors are requested to submit the replication package along with other production files. Upon submission, the Data Editor assigns the package to one or several members of the reproducibility team. The reproducibility team provides the Data Editor with a report summarizing the outcome of the checks. After reviewing it, the Data Editor contacts the authors informing them about the outcome of the replication checks, and eventually requests them to amend the package if needed. Once the replication checks are completed, the article is transferred back to the original Editor, who is in charge of final acceptance. If results in the paper need to be modified as a result of the checks, the original Editor in charge will be responsible for approving these changes before acceptance. If these changes imply a modification of the message of the paper, the original Editor can decide to reject the paper. Final acceptance is conditional on full reproducibility.\n\nWill the Economic Journal run my code?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Upon submission, the Data Editor assigns the package to one or several members of the reproducibility team, who will run your code and check the output generated. The reproducibility team provides the Data Editor with a report summarizing the outcome of the checks. In some instances, the code is too demanding to be run in a reasonable amount of time. In such cases, the Data Editor will be in contact with you with a recommendation for supplying a simplified version of the code that allows testing the essential parts of the code.\n\nWhat happens if my code is highly demanding computationally?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf the code is too demanding to be run in a reasonable amount of time, the Data Editor will be in contact with you with a recommendation for supplying a simplified version of the code that allows testing the essential parts of the code. For example, this can entail a reduced number of replications of a simulation exercise, the code that solves a structural model for a given set of parameters, a simplified function to test an optimization routine, etc. Such a simplified \"testing\" version will be published along with the original code in your replication package. This is so because we believe that these testing versions are extremely useful for other researchers that want to understand and use your code for replication or their related research, enhancing transparency and increasing the visibility of your research.\n\nWhat happens if the results fail to reproduce?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIf the data and code that you provided fail to replicate the results in the paper, the Data Editor will be in contact with you to identify the source of the discrepancy. Once the reproducibility checks are completed, if the discrepancy implies a change in the results presented in the paper or online appendices, even if minor, the Data Editor will notify it to the original Editor in charge. The Editor in charge will be responsible for approving these changes before acceptance. If these changes imply a modification of the message of the paper, the original Editor can decide to reject the paper. Final acceptance is conditional on full reproducibility.\n\nWhat happens if the replication package I provided is not complete?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe Data Editor will be in contact with you indicating the amendments and additions that need to be done to the replication package to pass the reproducibility checks. Once amended, the revised package will go through the checks again.\n\nWhat happens if the file I provided is not complete?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe Data Editor will be in contact with you indicating the amendments and additions that need to be done to the replication package to pass the reproducibility checks. Once amended, the revised package will go through the checks again.\n\nWhy do I need to resubmit the entire package (instead of only the revised part of it) when I incorporate the feedback received from the Data Editor and the reproducibility team?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWe need you to submit the entire package again because updating the replication package ourselves increases the potential risk that the files you intend to submit for possible publication may be mishandled."

    "text": "Content of the Replication Package\n\nWhat should be included in the replication package? Please see here.\nHow do I provide physical access to the replication team to my restricted-access data when I have been granted a data exemption?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nWhenever possible, the easiest way is to provide a physical copy of your data by including it in a separate folder labeled \"4 Confidential data not for publication\" outside of the replication package. All replicators and the Data Editor have signed confidentiality agreements that prevent them to use the data for any other purpose than the reproducibility checks. When that option is not feasible, we recommend you to contact our Data Editor to arrange the best way to provide access to the reproducibility team.\n\nWhy do I need to submit a signed checklist?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nTo ensure that you do not forget all elements of the replication package. This avoids repeated iterations and speeds up the process.\n\nShould I respect the folder structure dictated by the checklist, or is it only for orientation?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, you should and it is very important to do so. When submitted to production, your package is handled by different people at the Economic Journal and at the publisher, not all of them familiarized with data and code. Respecting the folder structure ensures that your package is published correctly.\n\nWhat information should be included in the ReadMe file? Please see here.\nShould I submit the raw data files and the code that generates my final dataset from them?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, this is requested by our Data and Code Availability Policy.\n\nWhy do I need to supply all text documents (ReadMe, IRB, etc.) in PDF format?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe PDF format is portable, which means that it can be transferred without having to worry about dependencies, fonts, etc. This ensures readability across platforms and users.\n\nWhy do I need to include a copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv, etc.)?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nSome users of your replication package may be not have access to the specific proprietary software that you used for your study. This ensures that they can have access to your data without problems. It also minimizes compatibility issues (e.g., old versions of Stata cannot open files saved by newer versions)."

    "text": "Reproducibility Certification, Publication of the Replication Package and Copyright Issues\n\nWhat kind of certification do we provide for papers that were checked for reproducibility?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThe empirical/simulation/experimental papers that we checked include the following statement: \"The data and codes for this paper are available at […]. They were checked for their ability to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\" This statement is adjusted accordingly when data exemptions are granted (acknowledging either that the authors provided temporary access to the confidential data or that the checks were implemented on simulated/synthetic data provided by the authors). In particular, we either certify \"The authors were granted an exemption to publish their data because access to the data is restricted. However, the authors provided a simulated or synthetic dataset that allowed the Journal to run their codes. The synthetic/simulated data and codes are available at […]. They were checked for their ability to generate all tables and figures in the paper, however, the synthetic/simulated data are not designed to reproduce the same results.\" or \"The authors were granted an exemption to publish their data because access to the data is restricted. However, the authors provided the Journal with temporary access to the data, which allowed the Journal to run their codes. The codes are available at […]. The data and codes were checked for their ability to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\", depending on the case that is applicable. These statements are combined accordingly when more than one situation applies. The statements are also also adjusted when the nature of the algorithms is highly demanding, and a partial/simplified version of the code has been used for the reproducibility checks: we add the sentence \"Given the highly demanding nature of the algorithms, the replication checks were run on a simplified version of the code, which is also available at […]\" to the applicable statement.\n\nWhere will the replication package be published?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nAfter all reproducibility checks are completed, you will be requested by the Editorial Office to publish your checked package at the Economic Journal’s community of Zenodo. Zenodo will assing your package a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which then will be linked with your publication.\n\nDo I keep the copyright of my package?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, one of the main advantages of you publishing the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo is that you are the sole responsible and copyright owner of the specific publication. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that you have permission to publish your data before the time of first submission and request an exemption then if you don’t.\n\nWhy are packages published at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo instead of with the article on the Journal’s website?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nThere are many advantages from publishing the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. Some of them are: (i) the author retains the copyright on the replication package, (ii) by having a specific DOI, it increases the visibility of all packages and, in turn, it increases the visibility of your article, and (iii) it makes it easier to cite.\n\nCan I post my replication material on other sites?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, as long as one copy is published at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. The only exception is when your replication package is published in a \"trusted\" repository (see the following list for guidance) with a permanent DOI. In that case, your DOI can be used to link your article with your package, and the Data Editor can wave the requirement to publish the package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo. However, publishing your package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo is recommended, because it increases the visibility of your package.\n\nAll data is publicly available. Do I still need to get permission from the website owner to post data on Economic Journal’s publisher website?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nEach provider offers a different policy regarding re-distribution of original and transformed datasets. Some providers, for example, allow re-distribution as long as your extract is deposited in a specific repository. You should make sure about the restrictions to publish your data before the first submission. You should also make sure to seek permission from the original owner of the data to publish them, and make sure to cite the original source accordingly. You will be the responsible of copyright infringements for what you publish with the replication package at the Economic Journal’s community at Zenodo.\n\nCan I retrospectively include a replication package as supplementary online material to my Economic Journal article?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nYes. Please address your request to the Editorial Office at ej@res.org.uk"

Drag-and-drop the zip file to upload it, as shown below. Make sure you only publish the replication package and not the paper or online appendices. Especially, do not publish the content of the 4-confidential-data-not-for-publication.zip folder! \nClick on the Start upload green button to upload.\nIf you didn’t skip step 2, your upload is already linked to the Economic Journal’s community. If your upload is not directly linked to the Economic Journal’s community, you can search the community on the search bar.\nFill the required metadata:\n\nUpload type: Software (or Dataset if you more applicable).\nPublication date: leave the default today’s date.\nTitle: Replication package for: “{full title of your manuscript}”.\nAuthors: Typically the same authors as the manuscript, but you can add others who have contributed significantly to the code you are uploading, such as research assistants (in that case, you are making them coauthors of your replication package, but not of the paper).\nDescription: write a full citation to your manuscript as a description of what the replication package contains.\nOther optional metadata: don’t worry about this, you can leave it blank. \n\nSelect an open-access license for your upload.\nSave the “Digital Object Identifier” (DOI) issued by Zenodo (see the image above) and email it to the Editorial Office at ej@res.org.uk. This DOI will appear in your published paper, and will hence link your article and your package.\nSave and then Publish using the corresponding buttons that appear both at the bottom and at the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Note\n\n\n\nonce you press publish, you will not be able to edit or delete your uploaded files. You can create new versions of your upload at any point in the future, but these versions will have a different DOI (they will be linked to your earlier and future versions of the package, but they will not be directly linked to your paper). Please double-check that you publish the files that went through the reproducibility checks, and that you are not publishing the content you submitted in the folder 4-confidential-data-not-for-publication.zip.\n\n\nSend an email to the Data Editor which includes the md5 string displayed on the zenodo page of your replication package (see below). This string serves to check whether the files included in the package, which the Data Editor has accepted, are exactly identical to the ones you uploaded to zenodo. This string is like an electronic fingerprint of your replication package. It’s important to note that you must not modify your package after final acceptance in any way (add/remove files or make edits), or this check will fail. What you upload needs to be exactly identical (at the bit-level of the contained files) to what you sent us in your final iteration."

Click here for a tutorial.\nUse programs/scripts as opposed to command-line instructions!\nDesign your code to be run all at once, and not section by section. Create a master file that calls all other subsidiary files.\nSet the paths only once and at the top of the master-file, and then use either relative paths or global variables, so that users don’t have to change the paths in multiple parts of your code.\nWhenever possible, write paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems. For example, in Stata, always use forward slashes / to separate directories, even if you use Windows.\nIf you are using software which requires compilation of source code into executables (e.g. Fortran, C, etc.), please use make files (or else make sure you provide very detailed instructions on how to compile the different files - we accept bash shell scripts).\nName your files in a wise manner. For example, if your output generates tables and figures as new files, give them names that easily identify them. Also, name your master file as “Main”, “Master” or something similar.\nUse sub-folders when your package includes a lot of files.

We recommend splitting your code into small subunits, each of which produce a dedicated output, for instance a function figure1() which would produce and save the file outputs/figure1.pdf in your package, where outputs/figure1.pdf is included via \\input{outputs/figure1.pdf} in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) source code of your paper as as Figure 1!
